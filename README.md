# social-justice-festival
Proj 3 for DES 228(final project omg)

# Project Overview
Intended for the purpose of creating our own three day festival highlighting and/or advocating for a chosen social justice movement or cause, this project is a site containing a 3-page guide which promotes not only our festival's events but our festival's collective cause. This final project is a culmination of the web design skills we've learned throughout the semester, and an opportunity to express what we're passionate about. 

This festival highlights the issue of racial inequity within United States legislature, and its prevalence throughout the Bay Area. Structured mainly as a conference, the various events planned to be held throughout the festival's three day tenure are provided with the intent to encourage Bay Area residents of voting age to advocate, and in turn act, in support of racial equity. This event plans to host local and possibly state government officials, local social justice groups and organizations, as well as other local representatives and community members who hold extensive knowledge/experience on racial inequity within the Bay Area.

The site will feature a guide to each day of the festival, a link to purchase tickets--plus other event/venue information--along with a selection of merchandise whose proceeds will go towards the same local and national organizations featured throughout the festival.
