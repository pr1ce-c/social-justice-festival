# social-justice-festival
Proj 3 for DES 228(final project omg)

# Project Overview
Tasked with the purpose to create our own three day festival highlighting and/or advocating for a chosen social justice movement or cause, this project is a site containing a 3-page guide which promotes not only our festival's events but our festival's collective cause. 

This festival highlights the issue of racial inequity within United States legislature, and its prevalence throughout the Bay Area. Structured mainly as a conference, the various events provided throughout the festival's three day tenure are provided with the intent to encourage Bay Area residents of voting age to advocate in support of racial equity.
