        <h2>who we are</h2>
        <p>We are a community-driven organization. e4A is deeply rooted within the Bay Area’s various counties: from San Francisco, to Contra Costa, Marin to Santa Clara–and almost every city in between. 
            Our members, officers and partners alike all have strong connections to the Bay, and have personal experiences living within its cities. 
            We are an organization made by the Bay’s people, for the Bay’s people.

            <h2>our values</h2>
            <p>At e4A, we recognize how colonialism, racism, and misogyny have influenced the decision-making of our country’s leading officials. 
                We have seen and experienced how such actions can have a significantly negative effect on minorities, not just on a national level, but in our own neighborhoods. 
                We value the reclamation of power into the hands of communities who have had too much taken from them in the past, and continue to face various barriers today.
                We value equal opportunity amongst all, no matter their race, gender, or place of origin.
